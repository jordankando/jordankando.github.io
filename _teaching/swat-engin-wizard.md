As an engineering student, I acted as a teacher's assistant in the following classes:

ENGR 019: Numerical Methods for Engineering (Fall 2020, Fall 2021)
======
This class covered introductory numerical modeling and Python, including algorithms including Newton's Method, Runge-Kutta, least-squares, and also served as an introduction to Python and its libraries. In 2020, I co-ran lab sections and homework help sections weekly, as well as graded labs. In 2021, I did the two former tasks, and helped proofread exams.


ENGR 012: Linear Systems Analysis (Spring 2022)
======
This class served as an introduction to examining linear systems in the Laplace domain, especially as applied to circuits and mechanical systems, and how to use MATLAB to do these computations. I co-ran weekly help sessions, and private tutored two students.
