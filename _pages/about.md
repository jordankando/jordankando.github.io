Hi! I am a first year Ph.D. student in Earth and Planetary Sciences at the [University of Hawaii at Manoa](https://www.soest.hawaii.edu/earthsciences/) and the [Hawaii Institute of Geophysics and Planetology (HIGP)](https://www.higp.hawaii.edu/) , advised by Dr. Shuai Li.  I am currently studying visible-band images of the lunar south pole for signs of water-ice, using a combination of observational data from the Narrow Angle Camera and Shadowcam, laboratory experiments, and radiative transfer modeling. My broader interests concern the use of data-driven techniques for characterizing planetary surfaces.

I am a recent graduate of [Swarthmore College]("https://www.swarthmore.edu"), where I earned a B.A. in Astrophysics and a B.S. in Engineering. My former, non-geoscience research has included projects on optical sensing and liquid crystals. I  have experience in computational geomorphology, where I used unsupervised machine learning techniques and shape parameters to investigate small periglacial drainage basins as a possibly useful terrestial analog. I also joined the Curiosity rover science team for a summer as a SURF@JPL intern, where I catalogued diagenetic nodular textures morphologically along the rover's traverse. For more information on these projects, check out the publications and/or talks tabs listed above.

If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions about my work, or just want to say hi, please feel free to reach out via. the links on the left!
