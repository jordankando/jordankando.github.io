This abstract was submitted based on work I completed remotely during my 11 week Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. A full-length paper has been in progress, so stay tuned!

This work adopts the methodologies of Sun et al. (2019) to examine diagenetic nodular textures in the Murray formation, as well as regions that would now be considered part of the Shoemaker formation. In addition to counting and mapping nodular textures, I also examined multispectral data from the rover. 

I was awarded the 2022 Dwornik Award for Best Undergradute Poster for this presentation. If you would like to see the poster, send me an email!
