excerpt: 'This paper is about pre-COVID laboratory work I did with Prof. Emeritus Peter J. Collings. We examined a lyotropic, chiral chromonic liquid crystal. I mixed samples of different chiral fraction and measured the pitch of the LC as a function of chiral fraction and temperature. Dr. Collings is the corresponding author on this paper, and did a majority of the writing.'
